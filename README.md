# module-1-challenge

## Description

The purpose of Module 1 Challenge was to learn about and practice refactoring starter code. One of the goals was to make the HTML more accessible by adding alt attributes and changing non-semantic elements to semantic elements, as well as making sure all of the links worked as intended. The other goal was to organize the CSS by consolidating it and putting it in the same order as the HTML, as well as adding comments.

## Installation

## Usage

All of the smaller images have an alt attribute. The largest image has a figcaption behind the image itself due to the image being a background image. The links in the navigation bar all lead to to their respective sections on the page when clicked.
